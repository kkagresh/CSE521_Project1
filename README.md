MultiThreaded Web Server
The objective of this project is to implement a multithreaded web server “myhttpd” in C/C++ on
a UNIX-based platform.

SYNOPSIS: myhttpd [−d] [−h] [−l file] [−p port] [−r dir] [−t time] [−n threadnum] [−s sched]

DESCRIPTION: myhttpd is a simple web server. It binds to a given port on the given address and waits for incoming HTTP/1.0 requests. It serves content from the given directory. That is, any requests for documents is resolved relative to this directory (the document root – by default,
the directory where the server is running).

2.1 OPTIONS:
−d : Enter debugging mode. That is, do not daemonize, only accept one connection at a time and enable logging to stdout. Without this option, the web server should run
as a daemon process in the background.

−h : Print a usage summary with all options and exit.

−l file : Log all requests to the given file. See LOGGING for details.

−p port : Listen on the given port. If not provided, myhttpd will listen on port 8080.

−r dir : Set the root directory for the http server to dir.

−t time : Set the queuing time to time seconds. The default should be 60 seconds.

−n threadnum: Set number of threads waiting ready in the execution thread pool to threadnum. The default should be 4 execution threads.

−s sched : Set the scheduling policy. It can be either FCFS or SJF. The default will be FCFS.
